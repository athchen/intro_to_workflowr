Typically the workflow for editing and publishing your results is as follows:

1. Open a new or existing R Markdown file in analysis/ (optionally using `wflow_open()`)
2. Perform your analysis in the R Markdown file.
3. Run `wflow_build()` to view the results as they will appear on the website (alternatively press the Knit button in RStudio)
4. Go back to step 2 until you are satisfied with the result/hit an intermediary step. 
5. Run `wflow_publish()` to commit the source files (R Markdown files or other files in code/, data/, and output/), build the HTML files, and commit the HTML files
6. Push the changes
